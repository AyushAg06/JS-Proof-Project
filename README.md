# JS Proof: Code Implementation and Creation

This is a JavaScript project which implements the use of all possible variables,functions,loops in Js. Here a program is executed which returns us the details of the employees working in that particular Company.



## Description 
Here in this program we print the details of the employee by passing parameters to the functions and when we call that partiular function we pass the values that is needed to be executed by the program. In this program we use a different function to print the details of the employee entered into an array and we also calculate the total no of employees working in the company with the help of no_of_emp function and finally we call all the functions we get the desired outputs.

## Components used

FUNCTIONS

In JavaScript functions are defined with the help of function keywords, followed by name and parentheses (). It reduces complexity in the code and helps in the re-usability of the code of a number of times.

LOOPS

Loops are the very essential features that are used in JavaScript. It is used to run the same portion of the code again and again, each time with a different value. There are mainly three types of loops that are- For loop,while loop and do-while loop.

ARRAY

Array are the special type of objects in JavaScript. It is used to store more than one values. We can declare an array with the help of const keywords.It is declared as 
const array = [10,20, ...];

OBJECTS

Objects is the special type of features used in JavaScript that is used to store values in names:values pair and it is declared inside {} brackets. It is declared as
const obj={"name":Ayush,"age":21,"course":JS};




## Running Tests

FUNCTIONS

```bash
function myFunction(a, b) 
{
  console.log(a * b);
}
myFunction(4, 3);
```

LOOPS

```bash
let i = 1;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while(i<=5)
```
ARRAY

```bash
const arr = [];
arr[0]= "Ayush";
arr[1]= "Piyush";
arr[2]= "Harsh";
```


## Summery

This is a project which aims to return the details of the employees working in an Company. We use an array to store the details of the employees and and we pass the details with the help of the function which stores the details of the employee and the the values the entered into it with the help of the parameters passed along with the functions. We use an another function to print all the nacessary details that we have entered in the other function. We have used do-while loop to execute all the details of the employee by setting the initial value as 0. And then we use another function to calculate the total number of employees working in the company.
Finally we call all the functions that we have defined above in order to execute the program and get the desired output.
## Conclusion

In this project we tried to use all the possible variables and keywords present in the JavaScript in defining a program which returns us the details of the employees present in the company. This project gives us a brief idea some of the key features of JavaScript and helps us to understand the importances of it in Web Development and other fields in the present world.
